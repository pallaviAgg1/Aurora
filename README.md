#Aurora: A Health-Conscious Smart Alarm Clock
Aurora is an intelligent alarm clock designed to help you wake up naturally and start your day on a positive note. It's more than just a timer; it dynamically adjusts to your daily routine and environment using smart software integrations.

Why Aurora is a Game-Changer
Intelligent Wake-Up: It connects with Google Maps, Weather, and Calendar APIs to factor in things like your commute, a sudden storm, or an early meeting, ensuring you wake up at the perfect time.

Prevent Oversleeping: The alarm is deactivated using a physical NFC sticker, which forces you to get out of bed to turn it off. No more mindlessly hitting the snooze button!

Personalized Experience: The systemâ€™s logic is engineered to align with your natural sleep cycles, helping you feel more refreshed and less groggy.

Intuitive Control: A beautifully designed, full-stack React web app gives you complete control over your schedules and settings.
